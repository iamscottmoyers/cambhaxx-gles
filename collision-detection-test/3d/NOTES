*** Only testing with GLUT at the moment ***
*** This is getting out of sync with the code in ../../src but its fine because its just stuff i'm playing with

setup a simple 3d collision test
- single view window (no rotation)
- generate 2 objects (1 fix, 1 moving 1 "block" each timestep)
- check collision
- printout details
- test all three dimensions

-- create and view bounding box around objects
-- initally stop on bounding box collision
-- on bounding box collision perform more finegrained checks
